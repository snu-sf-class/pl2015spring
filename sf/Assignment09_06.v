(** **** Exercise: 2 stars (slow_assignment)  *)
(** A roundabout way of assigning a number currently stored in [X] to
    the variable [Y] is to start [Y] at [0], then decrement [X] until
    it hits [0], incrementing [Y] at each step. Here is a program that
    implements this idea:
      {{ X = m }}
    Y ::= 0;;
    WHILE X <> 0 DO
      X ::= X - 1;;
      Y ::= Y + 1
    END
      {{ Y = m }} 
    Write an informal decorated program showing that this is correct. *)

Theorem slow_assignment : forall m,
    {{ fun st => st X = m }}
    Y ::= ANum 0;;
    WHILE BNot (BEq (AId X) (ANum 0)) DO
      X ::= AMinus (AId X) (ANum 1);;
      Y ::= APlus (AId Y) (ANum 1)
    END
    {{ fun st => st Y = m }}.
