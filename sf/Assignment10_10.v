(* problem #10: 10 points *)

(** The fact that small-step reduction implies big-step is now
    straightforward to prove, once it is stated correctly. 

    The proof proceeds by induction on the multi-step reduction
    sequence that is buried in the hypothesis [normal_form_of t t']. *)
(** Make sure you understand the statement before you start to
    work on the proof.  *)

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (multistep__eval)  *)
Theorem multistep__eval : forall t t',
  normal_form_of t t' -> exists n, t' = C n /\ t || n.
Proof.
