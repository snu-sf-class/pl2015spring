(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (loop_never_stops)  *)
Theorem loop_never_stops : forall st st',
  ~(loop / st || st').
Proof.
  intros st st' contra. unfold loop in contra.
  remember (WHILE BTrue DO SKIP END) as loopdef eqn:Heqloopdef.
    (* Proceed by induction on the assumed derivation showing that
     [loopdef] terminates.  Most of the cases are immediately
     contradictory (and so can be solved in one step with
     [inversion]). *)
  exact FILL_IN_HERE.
Qed.
