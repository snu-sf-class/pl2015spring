(* problem #08: 10 points *)

(** The postcondition does not hold at the beginning of the loop,
    since [m = parity m] does not hold for an arbitrary [m], so we
    cannot use that as an invariant.  To find an invariant that works,
    let's think a bit about what this loop does.  On each iteration it
    decrements [X] by [2], which preserves the parity of [X].  So the
    parity of [X] does not change, i.e. it is invariant.  The initial
    value of [X] is [m], so the parity of [X] is always equal to the
    parity of [m]. Using [parity X = parity m] as an invariant we
    obtain the following decorated program:
    {{ X = m }} ->>                              (a - OK)
    {{ parity X = parity m }}
  WHILE 2 <= X DO
      {{ parity X = parity m /\ 2 <= X }}  ->>    (c - OK)
      {{ parity (X-2) = parity m }}
    X ::= X - 2
      {{ parity X = parity m }}
  END
    {{ parity X = parity m /\ X < 2 }}  ->>       (b - OK)
    {{ X = parity m }}

    With this invariant, conditions (a), (b), and (c) are all
    satisfied. For verifying (b), we observe that, when [X < 2], we
    have [parity X = X] (we can easily see this in the definition of
    [parity]).  For verifying (c), we observe that, when [2 <= X], we
    have [parity X = parity (X-2)]. *)
