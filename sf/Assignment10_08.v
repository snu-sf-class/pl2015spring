(** **** Exercise: 3 stars (eval__multistep)  *)
(** The key idea behind the proof comes from the following picture:
       P t1 t2 ==>            (by ST_Plus1) 
       P t1' t2 ==>           (by ST_Plus1)  
       P t1'' t2 ==>          (by ST_Plus1) 
       ...                
       P (C n1) t2 ==>        (by ST_Plus2)
       P (C n1) t2' ==>       (by ST_Plus2)
       P (C n1) t2'' ==>      (by ST_Plus2)
       ...                
       P (C n1) (C n2) ==>    (by ST_PlusConstConst)
       C (n1 + n2)              
    That is, the multistep reduction of a term of the form [P t1 t2]
    proceeds in three phases:
       - First, we use [ST_Plus1] some number of times to reduce [t1]
         to a normal form, which must (by [nf_same_as_value]) be a
         term of the form [C n1] for some [n1].
       - Next, we use [ST_Plus2] some number of times to reduce [t2]
         to a normal form, which must again be a term of the form [C
         n2] for some [n2].
       - Finally, we use [ST_PlusConstConst] one time to reduce [P (C
         n1) (C n2)] to [C (n1 + n2)]. *)

(** To formalize this intuition, you'll need to use the congruence
    lemmas from above (you might want to review them now, so that
    you'll be able to recognize when they are useful), plus some basic
    properties of [==>*]: that it is reflexive, transitive, and
    includes [==>]. *)
